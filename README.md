# Internship-Day---1
Creating a command line calculator supporting basic operations.

We begin by using the def() which is used to declare a function block which can be executed  and reused multiple times.
After that we use the print() to let our user or tester know the function or operations our calculator can perform (+,-,*,/).
Then we use the while True, which allows us to create a loop.
We use the input() to take input from the user among the available operators.
we use the if, elif, else statement  to figure out the conditions required for performing various operation.
The int() and float() is used to change the input given by the user into number and decimals as it is string by default.
We use the try and except blocks to find any occurence of error within the input.
We then use the next block to figure if the user would like to continue or stop with the operations.
the break statement is used to terminate the executionof the loop.
